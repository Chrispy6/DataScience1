    <h2 align="center">In high school, I discovered my first punk band: <br>Blink-182.Except anyone born pre-1980 said <br> was blasphemy to call Blink-182 "punk" music.</h2>
    <p align="center"><strong>I have a theory:</strong> in 2015, Blink- 182 epitomizes punk culture, just as the Romones, Sex Pistols,<br> Black Flag, etc. did ten years ago. For the masses, Blink-182 isn't just pop-punk - its <i>real</i> punk. <br><br>
        More than any other genre, whether a band is "punk" is a debate in semontics. Punt has never <br> had a clear definition. I's a moving largel, rooled in principles rather than sound And in 2015,<br> an emerging generation can move that larget to whatever they want it to be, even a band who <br> might look/sound different than anything that preceded it. <br><br>
        What is punk, in 20159 There's no explicit place where people consciously son bands an "punk" <br> and "not-punk." But there is a sneaky source lo analyze: user-created Spoily and YouTube <br>playlists. By tallying who appears most often on ploylists riled with the word "punk", " we can <br> learn how parts of culture perceive genres and the bands who represent them.
