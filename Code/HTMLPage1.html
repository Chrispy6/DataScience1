<h1>Content</h1>
<p>The purpose of <b>design</b> is to enhance the presentation of the content it's applied to. It might sound obvious, but content being the <b>primary</b> element of a website, it should not be established as an afterthought.</p>
<p>Written content, like the paragraph you're currently reading, makes up for more than 90% of the Web. Styling this textual content will go a long way.</p>
